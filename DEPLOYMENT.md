## üöÄ Quick Deployment

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account with access to the repository: `https://github.com/blacktierob/internal-tool.git`
- Vercel account (recommended) or alternative deployment platform
- Supabase project with production database

### 1. Environment Configuration

Copy `.env.production` and update with your production values:

```bash
# Production Environment Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-production-supabase-url.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-production-anon-key
VITE_ENV=production

# Error Monitoring (Optional but Recommended)
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn-here

# Analytics (Optional)
VITE_POSTHOG_KEY=your-posthog-key-here
VITE_POSTHOG_HOST=https://app.posthog.com

# Security Configuration
VITE_SECURE_MODE=true
VITE_ENABLE_LOGGING=false
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

#### Option A: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import from GitHub: `blacktierob/internal-tool`
4. Add environment variables from your production config
5. Deploy

#### Option B: Deploy via CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not already installed
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy (from project root)
npm run deploy
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Setup

#### Database Migration
Ensure your Supabase database has the latest schema:
```bash
# Using Supabase CLI (if available)
supabase db push

# Or manually run migrations in Supabase dashboard
```

#### SSL Certificate
Vercel automatically provides SSL certificates. Ensure HTTPS is enabled.

#### Custom Domain (Optional)
1. In Vercel dashboard, go to your project
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Domains
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update DNS records as instructed

## üîß Build Configuration

### Build Scripts
- `npm run build` - Standard production build (without TypeScript checking)
- `npm run build:with-types` - Production build with TypeScript validation
- `npm run build:production` - Production build with NODE_ENV=production

### Bundle Analysis
The current build outputs approximately:
- **Total Size**: ~1.2MB (gzipped: ~370KB)
- **Main Bundle**: ~504KB (gzipped: ~166KB)
- **Vendor Chunks**: Properly split for caching

### Performance Optimizations Included
- ‚úÖ Automatic code splitting
- ‚úÖ Vendor chunk separation
- ‚úÖ Asset optimization
- ‚úÖ Gzip compression
- ‚úÖ Lazy loading of routes
- ‚úÖ Optimized dependency bundling

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Configuration

### Environment Security
- All sensitive data is stored in environment variables
- No secrets are committed to the repository
- Production mode disables debug features

### Content Security Policy
The application includes security headers via `vercel.json`:
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000

### Supabase Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies are enabled
- Anonymous access is controlled via API keys
- All data access is audited via activity logs

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Error Monitoring (Sentry)
If `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` is configured:
- Automatic error reporting
- Performance monitoring
- Session replays (with privacy controls)
- Error filtering for production

### Analytics (PostHog)
If `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` is configured:
- User behavior tracking
- Feature usage analytics
- Custom event tracking
- Privacy-first approach

### Application Monitoring
- Built-in activity logging system
- User action audit trails
- Database operation tracking
- Performance metrics via browser tools

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

### Automatic Deployment
The repository is configured for automatic deployment:
- Pushes to `master` branch trigger production builds
- Pull requests trigger preview deployments
- Build status is reported back to GitHub

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Build locally
npm run build:production

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Or deploy to other platforms
# Copy dist/ folder contents to your hosting provider
```

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Testing
- [ ] Login functionality works with production PINs
- [ ] Customer management operations function
- [ ] Order creation and management work
- [ ] Dashboard displays correct data
- [ ] All navigation works correctly
- [ ] Responsive design tested on mobile/tablet
- [ ] Print functionality works (if applicable)

### Security
- [ ] No development credentials in production
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Database access properly secured

### Performance
- [ ] Build size acceptable (<2MB total)
- [ ] Page load times under 3 seconds

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

#### Build Fails
```bash
# Check TypeScript errors
npm run typecheck

# Check for missing dependencies
npm install

# Clear build cache
rm -rf dist node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

#### Environment Variables Not Loading
- Ensure variables are prefixed with `VITE_`
- Check Vercel dashboard environment variable configuration
- Verify variables are set for production environment

#### Database Connection Issues
- Verify Supabase URL and key are correct
- Check network connectivity to Supabase
- Ensure RLS policies allow access
