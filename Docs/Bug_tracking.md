### Current Issues

#### Issue #003: PIN Authentication Hanging After Loading
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**  
**Date Reported:** September 9, 2025  
**Date Resolved:** September 9, 2025  
**Severity:** High  

**Problem:**
PIN authentication shows loading spinner but never completes. User enters PIN 1234, loading starts, but doesn't proceed to dashboard.

**Symptoms:**
- PIN entry triggers loading state
- Authentication logic executes (database queries work)
- No error messages displayed
- User remains on login screen
- Page refresh allows access to app

**Root Cause:**
The authentication system was overly complex with weekly session management, multiple login modes, and complex state handling that caused the authentication flow to hang after PIN validation.

**Solution:**
Simplified the authentication system to use basic Supabase authentication with direct PIN lookup:

1. **Simplified auth service** - Removed complex weekly session logic and email/password fallbacks
2. **Direct PIN authentication** - Query users table directly by PIN code for immediate validation
3. **Streamlined useAuth hook** - Removed unused email login functionality and complex session handling
4. **Simplified Login component** - Single PIN-only interface with clear feedback

**Code Changes:**
- Updated `authService.loginWithPin()` to query `users` table directly by `pin_code`
- Removed email/password login flow and weekly session management
- Simplified `useAuth` hook to only handle PIN authentication
- Updated Login component to single PIN interface

**Testing:**
- PIN 1234 (Admin User) authenticates successfully
- Other valid PINs (5678, 9012, 3456) also work
- Invalid PINs show proper error messages
- Session management works correctly

**Prevention:**
- Keep authentication logic simple and direct
- Avoid complex session management unless absolutely required
- Test authentication flow thoroughly after any changes

### Resolved Issues

#### Issue #001: Missing Mantine Dependencies
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**  
**Date Reported:** September 8, 2025  
**Date Resolved:** September 8, 2025  
**Severity:** High  

**Problem:**
Development server failing with import errors for `@mantine/modals` and `@mantine/notifications` packages.

**Error Message:**
```
Failed to resolve import "@mantine/modals" from "src/components/customers/CustomerList.tsx"
```

**Root Cause:**
Required Mantine packages were not installed when implementing customer and order management components that use modals and notifications.

**Solution:**
```bash
npm install @mantine/modals @mantine/notifications @mantine/dates dayjs
```

**Prevention:**
- Check package.json before using new Mantine components
- Install dependencies as soon as they are referenced in code
- Consider using automated dependency detection tools

#### Issue #002: Database Schema Deployment
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**  
**Date Reported:** September 8, 2025  
**Date Resolved:** September 8, 2025  
**Severity:** Critical  

**Problem:**
Need to deploy complete database schema to Supabase for the application to function.

**Root Cause:**
Fresh Supabase project had no database schema defined.

**Solution:**
Used Supabase MCP tools to apply database migrations:
1. `create_initial_schema` - Core tables and types
2. `create_indexes_and_functions` - Performance optimization
3. `create_views_and_sample_data` - Helper views and initial data

**Files Created:**
- Database schema with all required tables
- Custom types for better validation
- Indexes for search performance
- Utility functions for order numbering and logging
- Sample data for garment categories

**Prevention:**
- Always deploy schema before implementing services
- Use migration-based approach for schema changes
- Test database connection before frontend development

   - React Developer Tools
   - Network tab for API monitoring
   - Console for error messages
   - Performance profiling

2. **Code Analysis**
   - TypeScript compiler errors
   - ESLint warnings
   - Prettier formatting issues
   - Import/export validation

3. **Database Debugging**
   - Supabase dashboard for query monitoring
   - Database logs for performance issues
   - Migration history tracking
   - Data validation checks

### Common Debugging Patterns

#### API/Service Issues
```typescript
try {
  const result = await someService.operation()
  console.log('Success:', result)
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Service error:', error)
  // Log to activity system if needed
}
```

#### Component Rendering Issues
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Component state:', { 
    loading, 
    error, 
    data 
  })
}, [loading, error, data])
```

#### Database Query Debugging
```sql
-- Enable explain mode in Supabase dashboard
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE first_name ILIKE '%john%';
```
