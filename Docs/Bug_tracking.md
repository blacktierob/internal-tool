#### Issue #004: Mobile UI Layout Issues
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**  
**Date Reported:** September 10, 2025  
**Date Resolved:** September 10, 2025  
**Severity:** High  

**Problem:**
Multiple mobile UI issues were identified including:
- Logout and settings buttons floating near the top with inadequate spacing
- Header lacking proper padding for mobile devices
- Root CSS styles conflicting with AppShell mobile layout
- Missing touch-friendly optimizations for mobile users

**Symptoms:**
- Settings and logout buttons appeared cramped on mobile screens
- Poor touch targets and spacing on small screens
- Horizontal scrolling issues on mobile
- Inadequate mobile-specific CSS optimizations

**Root Cause:**
1. App.css root styling had desktop-focused layout (max-width, padding, centering) that interfered with Mantine AppShell
2. AppLayout component lacked mobile-specific responsive design considerations
3. Missing mobile-specific CSS rules for touch optimization
4. No mobile viewport optimizations in HTML meta tags

**Solution:**
Comprehensive mobile UI improvements:

1. **Fixed App.css root styling:**
   - Removed conflicting max-width, margin, padding, text-align
   - Set proper viewport sizing (100vh, 100vw)
   - Added mobile-specific CSS media queries

2. **Enhanced AppLayout component:**
   - Added isMobile media query detection
   - Implemented responsive header height (56px mobile, 64px desktop)
   - Optimized button sizes and spacing for touch
   - Used icon-only buttons on mobile for space efficiency
   - Improved navbar padding and touch targets

3. **Added comprehensive mobile CSS:**
   - Touch-friendly tap highlights and user selection rules
   - Prevented zoom on form inputs (font-size: 16px)
   - Smooth scrolling optimization
   - Minimum 44px touch targets enforcement
   - Improved focus states for mobile
   - Disabled hover effects on touch devices
   - Safe area insets support for mobile browsers

4. **Enhanced HTML viewport configuration:**
   - Added maximum-scale, user-scalable, viewport-fit for better mobile control

**Code Changes:**
- Updated `src/App.css` with mobile-first styling and touch optimizations
- Enhanced `src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx` with responsive design patterns
- Improved `index.html` viewport meta tag configuration

**Testing:**
- Build completed successfully with no errors
- Hot module replacement working correctly
- Mobile-responsive design patterns implemented
- Touch-friendly spacing and targets implemented

**Prevention:**
- Follow UI/UX documentation mobile-first approach
- Test mobile layouts during development
- Use proper responsive design patterns with Mantine
- Consider touch targets and mobile usability from the start

### Resolved Issues

#### Issue #003: PIN Authentication Hanging After Loading
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**  
**Date Reported:** September 9, 2025  
**Date Resolved:** September 9, 2025  
**Severity:** High  

**Problem:**
PIN authentication shows loading spinner but never completes. User enters PIN 1234, loading starts, but doesn't proceed to dashboard.

**Symptoms:**
- PIN entry triggers loading state
- Authentication logic executes (database queries work)
- No error messages displayed
- User remains on login screen
- Page refresh allows access to app

**Root Cause:**
The authentication system was overly complex with weekly session management, multiple login modes, and complex state handling that caused the authentication flow to hang after PIN validation.

**Solution:**
Simplified the authentication system to use basic Supabase authentication with direct PIN lookup:

1. **Simplified auth service** - Removed complex weekly session logic and email/password fallbacks
2. **Direct PIN authentication** - Query users table directly by PIN code for immediate validation
3. **Streamlined useAuth hook** - Removed unused email login functionality and complex session handling
4. **Simplified Login component** - Single PIN-only interface with clear feedback

**Code Changes:**
- Updated `authService.loginWithPin()` to query `users` table directly by `pin_code`
- Removed email/password login flow and weekly session management
- Simplified `useAuth` hook to only handle PIN authentication
- Updated Login component to single PIN interface

**Testing:**
- PIN 1234 (Admin User) authenticates successfully
- Other valid PINs (5678, 9012, 3456) also work
- Invalid PINs show proper error messages
- Session management works correctly

**Prevention:**
- Keep authentication logic simple and direct
- Avoid complex session management unless absolutely required
- Test authentication flow thoroughly after any changes

### Resolved Issues

#### Issue #001: Missing Mantine Dependencies
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**  
**Date Reported:** September 8, 2025  
**Date Resolved:** September 8, 2025  
**Severity:** High  

**Problem:**
Development server failing with import errors for `@mantine/modals` and `@mantine/notifications` packages.

**Error Message:**
```
Failed to resolve import "@mantine/modals" from "src/components/customers/CustomerList.tsx"
```

**Root Cause:**
Required Mantine packages were not installed when implementing customer and order management components that use modals and notifications.

**Solution:**
```bash
npm install @mantine/modals @mantine/notifications @mantine/dates dayjs
```

**Prevention:**
- Check package.json before using new Mantine components
- Install dependencies as soon as they are referenced in code
- Consider using automated dependency detection tools

#### Issue #002: Database Schema Deployment
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**  
**Date Reported:** September 8, 2025  
**Date Resolved:** September 8, 2025  
**Severity:** Critical  

**Problem:**
Need to deploy complete database schema to Supabase for the application to function.

**Root Cause:**
Fresh Supabase project had no database schema defined.

**Solution:**
Used Supabase MCP tools to apply database migrations:
1. `create_initial_schema` - Core tables and types
2. `create_indexes_and_functions` - Performance optimization
3. `create_views_and_sample_data` - Helper views and initial data

**Files Created:**
- Database schema with all required tables
- Custom types for better validation
- Indexes for search performance
- Utility functions for order numbering and logging
- Sample data for garment categories

**Prevention:**
- Always deploy schema before implementing services
- Use migration-based approach for schema changes
- Test database connection before frontend development

#### Issue #005: Full Mobile Breakpoint Audit
**Status:** ? **RESOLVED**  
**Date Reported:** September 10, 2025  
**Date Resolved:** September 10, 2025  
**Severity:** High  

**Problem:**
- On phones, screens felt cramped with key actions competing for space.
- Data tables could overflow horizontally on small screens.
- Navigation required too many taps due to hidden links.

**Root Cause:**
1. Tables did not provide horizontal scroll affordance on small screens.
2. Top actions and titles sat on a single line without wrapping.
3. No dedicated bottom navigation for phones as per UI/UX spec.

**Resolution:**
1. Added mobile bottom navigation (phones only) to surface primary destinations.
2. Wrapped tables in responsive scroll containers to prevent overflow.
3. Enabled wrapping in page header action groups to avoid crowding.

**Code Changes:**
- `src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx`
  - Added phone-only bottom nav via AppShell.Footer with primary routes.
- `src/components/orders/OrderList.tsx`
  - Wrapped table in Table.ScrollContainer (minWidth=820) and enabled Group wrap.
- `src/components/customers/CustomerList.tsx`
  - Wrapped table in Table.ScrollContainer (minWidth=720).
- `src/components/customers/CustomerDetailView.tsx`
  - Wrapped order/member tables in Table.ScrollContainer (minWidth=720).
- `src/components/orders/OrderDetailView.tsx`
  - Wrapped members and garments tables in Table.ScrollContainer.

**Testing Notes:**
- Verified columns hide appropriately at sm/md/lg breakpoints.
- Confirmed no horizontal scroll on body; scroll stays within tables.
- Footer appears only below 768px; AppShell adjusts main area accordingly.

**Follow-ups:**
- Consider reducing component sizes (`size="sm"`) on xs for dense screens.
- Evaluate Dashboard widgets for xs stacking and spacing.
